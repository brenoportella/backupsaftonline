This project provides tools for interacting with the SAFTOnline API and automating various tasks related to data backup and extraction. Overview The Backup SAFTOnline project consists of several components: - Driver Setup : Configuration and management of the web driver used for interaction with the SAFTOnline application. - Login : Automation of the login process to the SAFTOnline platform. - Data Extraction : Extraction of NIFs and other relevant data. - File Management : Handling of files related to data extraction and backup. Modules Driver The backupsaftonline.driver module handles the setup and teardown of the web driver. setup_driver : Configures and initializes the web driver for use with the SAFTOnline application. quit_driver : Cleans up and closes the web driver. Login The backupsaftonline.login module manages the login process. login(driver, email, password) : Logs into the SAFTOnline application using the provided email and password. Data Extraction The backupsaftonline.extract_nifs module is responsible for extracting NIFs and managing files. delete_file(file) : Deletes a specified file. download_nifs(driver) : Downloads NIF data using the web driver. read_xlsx(directory, filename) : Reads data from an Excel file. NIF Management The backupsaftonline.nifs module manages NIF data. nifs(file) : Reads NIFs from a specified text file. Search and Scrape The backupsaftonline.search_nif module handles searching and scraping data for a specific NIF. search_nif(driver, nif) : Searches for a specific NIF in the SAFTOnline application and navigates to the details page. Scraping The backupsaftonline.scrapy_nif module scrapes information related to NIFs. scrapy_nif(driver, file) : Scrapes data for multiple NIFs and collects relevant details. Backup The backupsaftonline.main module orchestrates the backup process. Backup Class : Manages the entire backup process, including login, data extraction, and file management. How to Use Setup the Environment : Install requirements and configure the environment. Set your website credentials : Set your login and password for saftonline. Choose your webdriver : Choose your prefer webbrowser to use. Start the program : Use python backup.py .
